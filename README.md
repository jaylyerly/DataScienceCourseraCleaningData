===============================

The script in this repository called `run_analysis.R` fulfills the following requirements for the course project in the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
  
The `run_analysis.R` script can be executed by either sourcing the file from within R (or RStudio) or by running it from the command line directly.

See the CodeBook.md file for a description of the data cleaning methodology.
